### CirclePondBot
A Discord.py bot which uses TensorFlow to "see" if the jets in UW's Drumheller Fountain are on.

Source code can be found at <https://github.com/WWRS/circlepondbot>.

[Invite the bot to your server here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=602156268551143424&permissions=51200&scope=bot)

### [UW Game Development Club Visualizer](https://github.com/uw-gamedev-visualizer/uw-gamedev-visualizer)
Polls live audio playing through the speakers and displays various visualizations.

If you've been to a club meeting since 2019, this was on the screen before the start of the talk!

Add your own visualizer and submit a pull request or contact me on Discord, `@RShields#5160`.

### [Fix the MyPlan Crashes](https://devpost.com/software/fix-the-myplan-overloads)
(Presented at DubHacks 2019)

This is an innovative solution to a problem with the University of Washington's online registration system: consistent overloads.

Source code can be found at <https://github.com/WWRS/Fix-the-MyPlan-Crashes/blob/master/main.rb>.

### [Triangles](https://rshieldsprojects.github.io/projects/triangles.html)

The [mice problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MiceProblem.html) asks, if a mouse starts at each vertex of a regular *n*-gon, then each travels toward the next mouse over, what paths will they trace?

This project answers that for triangles. Move the slider to change the granularity of the simulation.

### [Orbit](https://rshieldsprojects.github.io/projects/orbit.html)

A simulation of a planet's orbit. Move the slider to change the eccentricity of the orbit.

### [Quadtree](https://rshieldsprojects.github.io/projects/quadtree.html)

[Quadtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) are used to optimize 2-dimensional collision detection and to compress images.

This is a simple implementation of a quadtree, counting how many particles are in each branch. The "fuller" the branch, the redder its border.
