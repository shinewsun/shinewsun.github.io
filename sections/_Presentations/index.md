(With Abhishek Babu, Jim Limprasert, and Phuong Nguyen)  
MATH 380: Mathematics and Democracy, 17 December 2020

The [Penrose method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_method) purports to give more equal power distribution than apportionment methods currently in use. Why is it a *bad* method? Can its ideas be modifed to produce a better method?

### [Computer Graphics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GkyDD9hFsDdYpyslli4XSHbqTsd1CZe-MR0qlhGfAhs/edit?usp=sharing)

Game Development Club at UW, 13 May 2020

Most of the developers in the club use Unity, which handles rendering for us. How does Unity (or OpenGL for that matter) turn art assets into a frame of the game? How can shaders be used to affect that process?

### [Math in Game Design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pnc7Kz9kB5V9eIDqZEcf6KcgeD5tBAWzfrT3vdX5Hig/edit?usp=sharing)

Game Development Club at UW, 12 February 2020

You've heard of power curves. How are they made? How can we use spreadsheets for game balance and what should go on them?

### [Hyperbolic Geometry](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15_a928KItj27R1j1d21UtuY0cv6IIBdcoZS4lIZp6qY/edit?usp=sharing)

Washington Directed Reading Program, 4 December 2019

A presentation of a quarter of directed reading.  
What is hyperbolic geometry? How is it similar to and different from Euclidean geometry?

### [Cheating as Game Design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IlFVumS41ZG1X6CtP5BOT-UValeIc_y7caFjxa8EuwE/edit?usp=sharing)
